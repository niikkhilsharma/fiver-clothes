        "question": "What type of photos should I provide?",
        "answer": "You can send clear photos of your product. Lighting is key: natural light is ideal. Photos taken with a smartphone work perfectly as long as they are sharp and well focused. The more photos you provide, the better our system will understand your product, resulting in higher quality images and more dynamic angles in your final session."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many photos can I get?",
        "answer": "The number of photos generated will depend on the plan you choose and the specific details of your project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take for my photos to be delivered?",
        "answer": "Most projects are completed in **seconds**. However, during periods of high demand or for complex orders, the process may take up to **24 hours**. We will keep you informed about the progress of your order at all times."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rights do I have over the photos?",
        "answer": "You receive full commercial rights on all images submitted. You can freely use them on your website, social networks, marketing materials or advertising, without additional licensing costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I specify how I want my photo session?",
        "answer": "Of course! We encourage you to contribute your creative vision: tell us how you imagine your session and we will make it a reality. If you prefer, our team of experts can apply their professional experience to create stunning images that highlight your product perfectly."
